*[Click here](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-datasets-for-education) for the list of medical datasets.*

While making exercises to teach machine learning for healthcare, I've been spending a lot of time actively looking for appropriate datasets.

I came across some [curated lists of medical datasets on GitHub](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-datasets-for-education/#other-lists-of-medical-datasets), but the focus was typically more on research than on education - and the lists are more comprehensive than curated.

So I decided to [create one](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-datasets-for-education), with a specific focus on education - and thus where datasets have been (1) vetted for quality and (2) easily-accessible. You can access it [here](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-datasets-for-education).

I only have direct exposure to a limited subset of health datasets, and therefore for this to work the effort ultimately has to be crowd-sourced. I've populated the repository with some initial datasets, but am ultimately leaving it as a space that I hope others may contribute to.

I've you worked with a dataset that you've found helpful, and don't see it on the list, please consider adding it as per the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-datasets-for-education/#principles-of-this-repository).

If you're an educator looking to create educational content around medical data, I hope this repository can be a helpful resource.
