This is a slideshow presentation accessible [here](./slides/cnn-images) (originally delivered as part of [[Imperial Course|this module]] at Imperial College London).

It answers questions including:
- Why analyse images? (with use cases)
- How are images encoded for computers?
- How do convolutional neural networks work?
- What are the challenges of working with image data?
