This is a slideshow presentation accessible [here](./slides/clinical-ai-paper) (originally delivered as part of the [NHS Fellowship in Clinical AI](https://aicentre.co.uk/fellowships)).

It covers what makes reading clinical AI papers different to other papers and provides a framework for reading and interpreting clinical AI papers.

An accompany checklist of questions to ask when reading papers applying machine learning to healthcare can be found [here](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/med-ML-checklist/tree/main).
