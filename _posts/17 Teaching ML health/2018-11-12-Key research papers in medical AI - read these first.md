This is an extremely active research field, with new papers published regularly. Here we mention some of the landmark papers, with the intention of providing somewhat of an 'initial reading list' for those wanting to understand the area better.

(Note: we have only included peer-reviewed papers, and not those solely published on arxiv.)

For several of these papers, we have written [short summaries](https://explainthispaper.com) to outline the key findings and implications of the paper.
