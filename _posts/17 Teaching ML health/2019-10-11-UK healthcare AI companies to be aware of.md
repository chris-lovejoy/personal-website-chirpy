It’s useful to be aware of companies working in the healthcare AI space, whether it’s to understand the current state-of-affairs, to look for internships, future places to work or future organisations to collaborate with. Therefore, we’ve compiled some mini-profiles on the main UK-based companies doing work in the area.

Of course, the healthcare AI space is continually evolving, so we will endeavour to keep this list updated. We’ve included notes about career opportunities, but if there is other information you would like to know about each company, drop a comment at the bottom.

_NOTE: This article is UK-specific. There are many, many more in the United States, as well as other countries._
