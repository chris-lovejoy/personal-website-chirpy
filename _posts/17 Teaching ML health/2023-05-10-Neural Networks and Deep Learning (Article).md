This is a slideshow presentation accessible [here](./slides/neural-networks) (originally delivered as part of [[Imperial Course|this module]] at Imperial College London).

It answers questions including:
- How do neural networks work? (with worked examples)
- How do we train neural networks?
- How do we go from "simple" neural networks to deep learning?
