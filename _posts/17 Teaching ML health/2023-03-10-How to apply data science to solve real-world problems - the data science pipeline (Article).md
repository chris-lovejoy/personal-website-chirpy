This is a slideshow presentation accessible [here](./slides/data-science-pipeline) (originally delivered as part of [[Imperial Course|this module]] at Imperial College London).

It answers questions including:
- What does it mean to do data science?
- Why is data science useful?
- What is the "data science pipeline"?

And includes an in-depth consideration of the six steps of the data science pipeline.
