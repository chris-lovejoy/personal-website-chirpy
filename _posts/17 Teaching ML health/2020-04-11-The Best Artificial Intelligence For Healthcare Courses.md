We keep on hearing about how artificial intelligence and machine learning is going to revolutionise Medicine.

But whatâ€™s hype, and whatâ€™s realistic? And how can you get involved?

The first step is to understand the technology - where itâ€™s well-suited to healthcare (and where it isnâ€™t).

Thankfully, there are several online courses that can get us up to speed:

**UPDATE:** A bunch of new courses have been released and I haven't updated this list. So feel free to check out the below courses but be sure to do some research elsewhere too.



## [AI For Medicine](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-for-medicine/), by DeepLearning.AI

This course is taught by Pranav Rajpurkar, a PhD student at Stanford under Andrew Ng.

It covers AI for medicine across three domains:

-   AI For Medical Diagnosis (where youâ€™ll code a neural network to diagnose lung and brain disorders)
-   AI For Medical Prognosis (where youâ€™ll code risk models and prognosis predictors)
-   AI for Medical Treatment (where youâ€™ll write code to predict the effects of treatment)

Pranav and Andrew are prominent researchers in the field, so youâ€™re being taught by the best.

The course is pretty hands-on and technical. Therefore, it will be tough for people who arenâ€™t comfortable with coding.

Itâ€™s available [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) on Coursera. It costs $49 per month to enrol, so total cost will depend on how long you take to complete it (they advise it will take around 3 months at 7 hours/week).

## [Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-healthcare), by Stanford School of Medicine

The program is made up of five components:

-   Introduction to Healthcare
-   Introduction to Clinical Data
-   Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Healthcare
-   Evaluations of AI Applications in Healthcare
-   AI in Healthcare Capstone

The course is taught by a mix of faculty at Stanford University.

Itâ€™s aimed at an introductory level, and the focus is more on theory than practical (coding).

Iâ€™d recommend this one ahead of the DeepLearning.AI course if you have limited coding experience.

Links to each module on Coursera are available [here](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-healthcare). Each module is $79.

## [Machine Learning for Healthcare](/ml-health) (FREE), by Dr Chris Lovejoy

I made [this course](/ml-health) as a free alternative / precursor to the more serious courses.

Itâ€™s a nine-part video series that could probably be completed in an afternoon.

It provides a less-technical and more healthcare-tailored introduction to machine learning, and the nuances of applying it to healthcare.

Specifically, it covers:

-   What is machine learning and how do we train an algorithm?
-   What have â€˜neural networksâ€™ and â€˜deep learningâ€™ got to do with medicine?
-   How do we assess the performance and clinical impact of machine learning models?
-   How to read a medical machine learning paper
-   How can you combine machine learning with a medical career?

I filmed this in my living room, so itâ€™s not quite as professional as the courses above ðŸ˜….

But Iâ€™m keen to lower the barrier-to-entry for learning about ML, so I hope this is a good introduction for those on-the-fence about paying for a multi-week course.

It's available [here](/ml-health) or as a [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_mF4OlcUY&list=PLZz4IsmMUFBxfuW059IEdqtPuytFG-vae&ab_channel=ChrisLovejoy).

If you enjoy this course, definitely consider taking one of the above courses as a follow-on.

## Other courses?

This is a hot topic, so Iâ€™m sure other courses will pop up over time.
