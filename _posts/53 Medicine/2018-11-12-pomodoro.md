For an explanation of the Pomodoro Method, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0k0TQfZGSc).

Here are some points that I found maximised the benefit I got from it:

-   Having a fixed timer which does it for you (rather than setting and re-setting alarms) is helpful: for example, the physical Pomodoro timer, tomato-timer.com for in-browser or Tomighty as a desktop app.
-   Sticking diligently to the timings (of 25-5-25-5), so you can plan exactly how many 'pomodoros' you will do before lunchtime, say, or another commitment.
-   Doing something that you enjoy or doing exercise during the 5-minute breaks (away from the computer/study area). I will do small admin stuff if I have a lot (for example, washing dishes, doing laundry), otherwise I will skim a book chapter, read a short blog post or listen to a favourite song. Doing short bursts of exercise, such as squats, planks or sit-ups, can both bring your energy level up and be a good way to squeeze in exercise to free up time later. I often find the first one or two pomodoros of a day quite difficult but am re-energised by later ones.
-   Alternating it with some other approach â€“ I personally found morning Pomodoros followed by less-structured afternoon study sessions more effective.
