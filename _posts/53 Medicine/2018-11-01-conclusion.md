Medical school can be tough but it can also provide some of the best times of our lives. Our approach to medical school can determine the projection that the rest of our medical career takes. In this book, I have laid out the approach that I believe a medical student in the 21st century should take. I sincerely hope that it helps you to get the most out of your medical school experience to set up a successful and fulfilling career.

I hope that [Chapter 1](/chapter-1) helps you to find that ever-elusive work-life balance and that Chapters [2](/chapter-2) and [3](/chapter-3) help you to excel academically while having more time for other things. I hope that [Chapter 4](/chapter-4) helps you to make an impact in medicine and, in combination with Chapters [5](/chapter-5) and [6](/chapter-6), helps you to find an area of passion and develop fundamental transferrable skills for whatever path your life takes.

Throughout the book, I set four ‘Medical Student Challenges’. Here they are again. Feel free to print the table below, and tick them off once completed.

## Epilogue

### Thank you!

Thank you for reading this book. I sincerely hope that you got a lot out of it. I worked hard to make sure it would be a worthwhile read.

### Tell your friends

I appreciate that not all parts of this book will appeal to all people. My aim has been to cover enough areas and different perspectives that anybody who reads the book will gain something from doing so. If you have a friend or family member who would enjoy it, please let them know about it or, better yet, [buy them a copy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Medical-Student-Manual-fulfilling/dp/1973413590/). I don’t have a marketing team or money to invest in advertisement, so I rely on word of mouth… and I’m sure they will like it too!


### Get in touch
