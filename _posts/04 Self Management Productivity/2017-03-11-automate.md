### Automate what you hate, but have to do anyway and the power of batching

The below diagram is from [Chris Suave’s TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbVQNTzCh8). He suggests, for all tasks:

-   If you hate it and don’t have to do it, **eliminate it**
-   If you hate it but have to do it, **automate it**
-   If you love it, **focus on it**

### **Trivial things to automate or eliminate: some examples**

I spent a lot of time grocery shopping, so now I order home delivery from a saved online shopping list. I spent a lot of time washing dishes, so now I eat off paper plates. I spent a lot of time cooking, so now I batch cook seven or eight meals at a time which I find more enjoyable and lasts a number of days.

What trivial activities do you spend time on and how could you automate or eliminate them?

### **Batching necessary but boring tasks**

By batching multiple tasks, you avoid the ‘cognitive switching penalty’ [described by Josh Kaufman](https://sivers.org/book/PersonalMBA). Every time you switch from one task to another, you brain takes a while to adapt and a portion of your cognitive functioning has been shown to continue working on the previous task regardless.

**Email** is a prime example and is the bane of many people’s lives. The most efficient way to use it is to follow two rules:

1.  Check it only once or twice a day (this means turning off any notifications)
2.  Process each email individually until no more action is required

### Weekly batching

Certain tasks only need to be done at most once a week so batching them on the weekend saves doing them during the week. Some tasks can easily be forgotten without a scheduled weekly slot until they build up to unmanageable levels or cause problems.

My list of weekly admin tasks is as follows:

-   Laundry
-   Clear in-tray (where I drop anything non-urgent that pops up during the week)
-   Order online shopping (see above)
-   Weekly bike maintenance (oil chain, check tyre pressures, adjust gears, etc)
-   Trim beard
-   Perform PC maintenance (Run CCleaner, DeFraggler, deep antivirus scan, clear downloads folder)
-   Re-stock phone and kindle (remove read audiobooks and add this weeks to-read)

Obviously this is very specific to me but gives an impression of the sort of things that are useful to batch weekly.

**By saving time on things that aren’t important to me, I find more time for the things that are, like friends, hobbies and creative endeavours.**
