I've often had goals - sometimes in my head, at other times written down - but until now I've had no central place that I've stored them. Inspired by Thomas Frank's ["Impossible List"](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/), I've decided to change that.

Apparently an "Impossible List" is different to "just a bucket list" in that it is **_"an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, help others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action."_**

As I understand, the key ideas differences:

-   It **inspires you to take action** right now (rather than achieve something further down the line)
-   It's **public** (I guess for accountability, and perhaps to help others)
-   It's **iterative** (so when you achieve a goal, you may decide to set a further, more challenging, next step)

I'm hoping this list will help me retain clarity and focus, and also avoid the sensation that [I haven't accomplished anything in my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR-HD3RA-AE) by having a concrete record of the small wins.

So, here's my list (work in progress):
