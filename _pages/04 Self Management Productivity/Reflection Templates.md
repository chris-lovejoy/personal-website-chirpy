# TEMPLATE 2 (from Derek Sivers)

### What's wrong?

### Am I in danger?

### Am I in pain?

### Consider:
-   **Why is that bad?**
-   **What could be good about this problem?**
-   **Why did I want this in the first place?**
-   **Is there another way to get this?**
-   **What would this look like if it were easy?**
-   **What's easier now considering the new situation?**
-   **What's the most direct way to get what I wanted?**
-   **What if I decide to embrace the opposite, and do the opposite of what I had planned?**
-   **What would be the most interesting of the new options?**
-   **What would the plan that goes with the flow of past experiences?**
