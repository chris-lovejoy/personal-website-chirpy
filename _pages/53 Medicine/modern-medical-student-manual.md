I wrote this book shortly after finishing medical school, in Cambridge, UK. It started out as a short guide for my sister, who was about to start medical school, but turned into something more substantial.

Below is the official description but I think the [introduction](/intro) gives a better idea of what the book is about.

The eBook can be downloaded for free [here](https://chrislovejoy.gumroad.com/l/medstudentmanual), while a paperback copy can be bought from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2HFGoQY) or [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-ultimate-guide-to-being-a-medical-student/chris-lovejoy//9781912557417).

## Book Description

In The Modern Medical Student Manual, Dr Chris Lovejoy presents a fresh perspective on how to approach learning medicine in the 21st century.

The book brings in insights from a wide range of sources and combines them with the personal experiences of the author and others of learning medicine. It contains highly practical advice for succeeding in the ‘conventional’ aspects of medical school; written exams, OSCEs, learning from the wards and scientific research, whilst also considering “bigger picture” questions, such as how to find a work-life a balance, enjoy what you’re doing and maximise your positive impact.

Written by a fresh medical school graduate, and with contributions from highly successful students and doctors across multiple domains, this book contains something for everyone.

### **Inside, you will learn:**

-   The **core science-backed learning principles** for performing better while studying less.
-   How to **utilise techniques of ‘world-class performers’** to develop excellent diagnostic skills.
-   Suggestions for finding the **optimum balance between work and play.**
-   Four **guiding principles** for making the most of time spent on the wards.
-   An optimal approach to **scientific research** as a student and a method for generating research ideas.
-   The **challenges of communication** in healthcare and how to prepare as a student.
-   How to go from struggling to write essays to **winning essay prizes.**
-   How to create a **competitive medical CV** through doing things you enjoy.
-   Five techniques for **pulling yourself out of a low mood** when medicine or life gets you down.
-   How to **assess whether medicine is right for you**.
-   Considerations for **maximising the positive impact** of your medical career and **finding a career path you love**.

### Praise for the Modern Medical Student Manual:

“‘The Modern Medical Student Manual’ combines personal anecdote and a philosophical approach that stands out for the shortness of its nature and the uniqueness of its disposition. There is something to be said for a short guide for medical students written by a recently graduated Foundation Year doctor.” – **Excerpt from [review in Cambridge Medical Journal](http://doi.org/10.7244/cmj.2017.12.002)**

“Brilliant! Inspired me to make the most of my time in med school and has given me the tools to do so. The author’s way of combining his own experiences as a med student with the ideas of lots of smart people to produce advice that’s easy to implement in everyday life is super useful.” – **Eveliina Ilola, Medical Student, Kings College London**

“Great book, would highly recommend to others. Perfect for anyone thinking about or currently studying medicine who wants to succeed at medical school and make a difference.” – **[Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/), Medical YouTuber and Founder of 6med**

“This book addresses so many aspects of the medical school journey, and had it been available back when I started, it would have been incredibly valuable. The book offers some very refreshing and innovative approaches to learning, but also some great tips on truly making the most of the professional experience, over and above excelling at the basic medical degree.” – **Vignesh Vetrivel, Cambridge Medical Graduate and Strategy Consultant**
